I am a graduate student in the M.Sc. program in Geodesy and Geoinformation (GuG) at [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/en/). Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree from [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/) in 2023. Currently, I am completing my internship at [COWA Robot](https://www.cowarobot.com/) in Shanghai.

My research interests include robotic perception and multi-modal localization.
